# 🖼️ Expanding Flex Panels

A stylish interactive image gallery built with CSS Flexbox and JavaScript. Clicking a panel expands it with a smooth transition, revealing text content with animation.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Using CSS Flexbox for dynamic, responsive layouts
- Animating layout changes with CSS transitions
- Listening to the `transitionend` event for precise control
- Toggling multiple classes to trigger animations
- Building smooth interactive UI with just HTML, CSS, and JS

## 💡 Features I Added
- Implemented accordion behavior: only one panel can be open at a time
- Automatically closes previously opened panels on new click
- Cleaned up `toggleOpen()` and `toggleActive()` logic for better readability
- Prevented redundant class toggling to improve performance and transitions

## 🗂️ Files
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`
